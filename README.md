# arroyo-hydroacoustic-logger
Hydroacoustic adaptation of the Solo datalogging system (https://github.com/solo-system), designed for monitoring bedload transport during intermittent flow events in arroyos. Includes water-activated watchdog switch to power up the system and initiate datalogging only when the arroyo is flowing.
